# AutoRSA Discord Bot and CLI Tool
A CLI tool and Discord bot to buy and sell the same amount of stocks across multiple accounts!

## What is RSA?
RSA stands for "Reverse Split Arbitrage." This is a strategy where you buy the same amount of stocks in multiple accounts across multiple brokers right before a stock performs a reverse split. Once the stock splits and your fractional share is rounded up to a full share, you profit!

This project will allow you to maximize your profits by being able to easily manage multiple accounts across different brokerages, buying and selling as needed.

## Discord Bot Installation
### Docker
View on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nelsondane/auto-rsa)
<!-- 1. Clone the repo and cd into it -->
1. Create a `.env` file for your brokerage variables, and add your bot using `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_CHANNEL`
2. Then run:
```bash
 docker run --env-file ./.env -itd --restart unless-stopped --name rsa nelsondane/auto-rsa:latest
```
4. The bot should appear online (You can also do `!ping` to check). 

See below for more command explanations.

### Always Running Python Script
Make sure python3-pip is installed
1. Clone this repository and cd into it
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file for your brokerage variables, and add your bot using `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_CHANNEL`
4. Run `python autoRSA.py` (See below for more command explanations)

## CLI Tool Installation
1. Clone this repository and cd into it
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file for your brokerage variables using `.env.example` as a template.
4. Run `playwright install-deps`
5. Run the script using `python pythonRSA.py <action> <amount> <ticker> <account> <dry>` (See below for more parameter explanations)

## Usage
### Discord Bot
Once the bot is invited to your server, you can check that it's running by sending:

`!ping`

To buy and sell stocks, just send a message of this format in discord:

`!rsa <action> <amount> <ticker> <account> <dry>`

For example, to buy 1 STAF in all accounts:

`!rsa buy 1 STAF all false`

For a dry run of the above command in Robinhood only:

`!rsa buy 1 STAF robinhood true`

To check your account holdings:

`!holdings <account>`

To see when the market opens/closes:

`!market` or `!market_hours`

To restart the bot:

`!restart`

For help:

`!help`

### CLI Tool:
To buy and sell stocks, just this command when in the repo directory:

`python pythonRSA.py <action> <amount> <ticker> <account> <dry>`

For example, to buy 1 STAF in all accounts:

`python pythonRSA.py buy 1 STAF all false`

For a dry run of the above command in Robinhood only:

`python pythonRSA.py buy 1 STAF robinhood true`

To check individual account holdings:

`python pythonRSA.py holdings <account>`

### Parameters
- `<action>`: "buy" or "sell"
- `<amount>`: Amount to buy or sell. Must be an integer
- `<ticker>`: The stock ticker to buy or sell
- `<account>`: What brokerage to run command in (robinhood, schwab, etc, or all)
- `<dry>`: Whether to run in "dry" mode (in which no transactions are made, useful for testing). Set to True, False, or just write "dry" for True. Defaults to True, so if you want to run a real transaction, you must set this to False/dry.

### Test Login
To test your login credentials, run `python testLogin.py`. This will show whether it detected your login credentials correctly, and attempt to login to each brokerage. If you wish for you `.env` variables to be shown, run `python testLogin.py show`.

## Supported brokerages:
### Ally
Made using [PyAlly](https://github.com/alienbrett/PyAlly). Go give them a ⭐

Required `.env` variables:
- ALLY_CONSUMER_KEY
- ALLY_CONSUMER_SECRET
- ALLY_OAUTH_TOKEN
- ALLY_OAUTH_SECRET
- ALLY_ACCOUNT_NBR

To get these, follow [these instructions](https://alienbrett.github.io/PyAlly/installing.html#get-the-library)

### Fidelity
Made by yours truly using Selenium (and many hours of web scraping).

Required `.env` variables:
- FIDELITY_USERNAME
- FIDELITY_PASSWORD

At this time, the bot only works using the `old view` Fidelity site. The bot will attempt to switch to the `old view` if it detects you are on the `beta view`, but if you encounter issues, you may need to switch to the `old view` manually.

### Robinhood
Made using [robin_stocks](https://github.com/jmfernandes/robin_stocks). Go give them a ⭐

Required `.env` variables:
- ROBINHOOD_USERNAME
- ROBINHOOD_PASSWORD
- ROBINHOOD_TOTP: If 2fa enabled

Configuring 2fa can be tricky, read the TOTP section [here](https://github.com/jmfernandes/robin_stocks/blob/master/Robinhood.rst)

### Schwab
Made using the [schwab-api](https://github.com/itsjafer/schwab-api). Go give them a ⭐

Required `.env` variables:
- SCHWAB_USERNAME=
- SCHWAB_PASSWORD=
- SCHWAB_TOTP_SECRET= (If 2fa is enabled)

To get your TOTP secret, use [this website by the api author above.](https://itsjafer.com/#/schwab). Then log in to your Schwab account, and use the code for 2FA.

### Tradier
Made by yours truly using the official [Tradier API](https://documentation.tradier.com/brokerage-api/trading/getting-started)

Required `.env` variables:
- TRADIER_ACCESS_TOKEN

To get your access token, go to your [Tradier API settings](https://dash.tradier.com/settings/api)

### Maybe future brokerages
#### Chase
I will be signing up for a Chase account soon, and I have heard that it is possible, so I will be looking into it soon.
#### Vanguard
Will be added using Selenium just like Fidelity. I found this [vanguard-api](https://github.com/rikonor/vanguard-api), but it failed when I ran it.
#### SoFi
Login requires SMS 2fa, and I'm not sure how to do that automatically.
#### Webull
Not currently working since login is broken in [webull](https://github.com/tedchou12/webull). They also use SMS 2fa, so I'm not sure how to do that automatically.
#### Public
Same as Webull and SoFi.
### Never working brokerages
#### Stash
Why.
