## ‚ùì What is RSA? ‚ùì
You already know what Reverse Split Arbitrage is, that's not why you're here. If you do know what it is, then you know why a tool like this would be valuable. If you're a big player, even more so...

## ü§î How Does It Work? ü§î
This program uses APIs to interface with your brokerages. When available, official APIs are always used. If an official API is not available, then a third-party API is used. As a last resort, Selenium or Playwright Stealth are used to automate the browser.

## ü§ñ Discord Bot Installation ü§ñ
To create your Discord bot and get your `DISCORD_TOKEN`, follow this [guide](guides/discordBot.md).
### üê≥ Docker üê≥
1. Create a `.env` file for your brokerage variables using [.env.example](.env.example) as a template, and add your bot using `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_CHANNEL`
2. Using the provided [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file, run the command `docker compose up -d` inside the project directory.
3. The bot should appear online (You can also do `!ping` to check). 

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Always Running Python Script üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Make sure python3-pip is installed
1. Clone this repository and cd into it
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file for your brokerage variables using [.env.example](.env.example) as a template, and add your bot using `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_CHANNEL`
4. Run `python autoRSA.py` (See below for more command explanations)

Note: If you are using Windows, you will need to install playwright manually. See [this guide](guides/playwrightWindows.md) for more information.

## üíª CLI Tool Installation üíª
1. Clone this repository and cd into it
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file for your brokerage variables using [.env.example](.env.example) as a template.
4. Run the script using `python autoRSA.py` plus the command you want to run (See below for more command explanations)

Note: If you are using Windows, you will need to install playwright manually. See [this guide](guides/playwrightWindows.md) for more information.

## üëÄ Usage üëÄ
If running as a Discord bot, append `!rsa` to the beginning of each command.
If running from the CLI Tool, append `python autoRSA.py` to the beginning of each command.

To buy and sell stocks, use this command:

`<action> <amount> <ticker> <accounts> <dry>`

For example, to buy 1 AAPL in all accounts:

`buy 1 AAPL all false`

For a dry run of the above command in Robinhood only:

`buy 1 AAPL robinhood true`

For a real run on Fidelity and Robinhood, but not Schwab:

`buy 1 AAPL fidelity,robinhood not schwab false`

For a real run on Fidelity and Robinhood but not Schwab buying both AAPL and GOOG:

`buy 1 AAPL,GOOG fidelity,robinhood not schwab false`

To check your account holdings:

`holdings <accounts>`

To restart the Discord bot:

`!restart` (without appending `!rsa`)

For help:

`!help` (without appending `!rsa`)

Note: There are two special keywords you can use when specifying accounts: `all` and `day1`. `all` will use every account that you have set up. `day1` will use "day 1" brokers, which are Robinhood, Schwab, Tastytrade, and Tradier. This is useful for brokers that provide quick turnaround times, hence the nickname "day 1".

### ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters ‚öôÔ∏è
- `<action>`: string, "buy" or "sell"
- `<amount>`: integer, Amount to buy or sell.
- `<ticker>`: string, The stock ticker to buy or sell. Separate multiple tickers with commas and no spaces.
- `<accounts>`: string, What brokerage to run command in (robinhood, schwab, etc, or all). Separate multiple brokerages with commas and no spaces.
- `<not accounts>`: string proceeding `not`, What brokerages to exclude from command. Separate multiple brokerages with commas and no spaces.
- `<dry>`: boolean, Whether to run in `dry` mode (in which no transactions are made. Useful for testing). Set to `True`, `False`, or just write `dry` for`True`. Defaults to `True`, so if you want to run a real transaction, you must set this explicitly.

## üò≥ DISCLAIMER üò≥
DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial advisor and not affiliated with any of the brokerages listed below. Use this tool at your own risk. I am not responsible for any losses or damages you may incur by using this project. This tool is provided as-is with no warranty.

## üëç Supported brokerages üëç

All brokers: separate account credentials with a colon (":"). For example, `SCHWAB_USERNAME:SCHWAB_PASSWORD`. Separate multiple logins with the same broker with a comma (","). For example, `SCHWAB_USERNAME:SCHWAB_PASSWORD,SCHWAB_USERNAME2:SCHWAB_PASSWORD2`.

Some brokerages require `Playwright` to run. On Windows, the `playwright install` command might not be recognized. If this is the case, run `python -m playwright install` instead.

### ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Maybe future brokerages ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
#### Ally
Ally disabled their official API, so all Ally packages don't work. I am attempting to reverse engineer their API, and will add it if I get it working. Otherwise, I will use Selenium or Playwright.
#### Vanguard
Will be added using Selenium or Playwright.
#### SoFi
Will be added using Selenium or Playwright.
### üëé Never working brokerages üëé
#### Stash
Why.
